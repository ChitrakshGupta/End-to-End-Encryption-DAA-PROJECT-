# End-to-End-Encryption-Design and Analysis Of Algorithims-Project
## Text Encryption and Decryption 
Created By: Anish Garg and Chitraksh Gupta
This project allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using a character substitution method. You can also save the encrypted or decrypted message to a text file.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: Python Downloads

## Usage
Once you have executed the script, you will see a menu with the following options:

Encrypt a message: Allows you to enter a message and encrypt it using a character substitution method.
Decrypt a message: Allows you to enter an encrypted message and decrypt it to its original form.
Exit: Terminates the program.

## Encrypting a Message
To encrypt a message, follow these steps:

Choose the option "Encrypt a message" by entering 1 and pressing Enter.
Enter the message you want to encrypt. Only characters from the set of punctuation, digits, letters, and spaces are allowed.
If any invalid characters are detected, an error message will be displayed. Please remove or replace the invalid characters and try again.
The encrypted text will be displayed on the screen.
You can choose to save the encrypted message to a file by entering y and providing a file name when prompted. The encrypted message will be saved in the specified file.
Decrypting a Message
To decrypt a message, follow these steps:

Choose the option "Decrypt a message" by entering 2 and pressing Enter.
Enter the message you want to decrypt. Make sure it is a message that was encrypted using the same character substitution method.
If any invalid characters are detected, an error message will be displayed. Please remove or replace the invalid characters and try again.
The decrypted text will be displayed on the screen.
You can choose to save the decrypted message to a file by entering y and providing a file name when prompted. The decrypted message will be saved in the specified file.
Exiting the Program
To exit the program, choose the option "Exit" by entering 3 and pressing Enter.
